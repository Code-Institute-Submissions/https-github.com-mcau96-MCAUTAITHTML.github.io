PT Guru-Training 101

The PT Guru website is a gym advertisement page, where users will be able to find out the gym location, timetable of classes and a motivational interactive video to gain engagement. The aim of the website is to gain potential business for the gym and highlight the benefits of joining.

Navigation

The navigation menu is in the top right of the screen and features three options. Home will take the user back to the first page of the website. Motivation Station will take the user to the interactice video page, while contact will take the user to the gym contact page which also contains the class timetable. Also by clicking the logo in the top left of the screen, the user is taken back to the home page

The three options are clearly separated to make navigation through the three pages easy for the website user

The Header 

The header displays the gym logo very clearly, to give a sense of awe when the user views it. Its clearly displayed white against the dark background so that it stands out to the user.

Home Page

The Home Page offers users a look into the gym and its motivations. Its structed into two pages with social media icons at the bottom. It also has a clickable button in the centre of the first page which takes viewers to the motivation station page, which provides a neat interactive option for the website viewer.

The Contact Section

The contact section allows website users to view the gyms location, and also the timetable of the gyms classes. It is laid out clearly in a structed format, whith each class offer situation on a new line as to avoid confusion. Links to social media are provided at the bottom of the page.

Motivation Station

The Motivation Station section contains an interactive video, with the intention to motivate users and give them more reason to visit the gym. The video is embedded from youtube and can be viewed on the website page rather than a link to youtube itself.

I have tested each of the interactive features to esnure they are running smoothly.

I have tested how responsive the website looks on different screens using dev tools.
